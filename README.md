## 👋🏻 Hi there!
Hi! I'm João Lucas, 22, a Computer Science student at [UFBA](https://ufba.br/)

I'm currently working at Serpro as an intern. I use Angular, Java, and SQL to manage diverse applications.

I’m currently learning about data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. Recently, i did a [CG project](https://github.com/jlucasldm/backrooms) that really got me into game development. So, to start to learn about it, I'm working on a [Doom project](https://github.com/jlucasldm/doom).

I also LOVE movies. I try to study it on my own, but I do want to, at some point, join a university to study it academically.


### 💻 Some cool projects i made:
- [Backrooms](https://github.com/jlucasldm/backrooms): A virtual environment set in the popular creepy pasta The Backrooms
- [Doom](https://github.com/jlucasldm/doom): A remake of the original 93 game, using python
- [Cops and Robbers](https://github.com/jlucasldm/trabalho-grafos): An algorithmic translation of a mathematical theorem to define a winning condition in a Cop and Robbers game
- [Client-Server Application](https://github.com/jlucasldm/trabalho-redes): A client-server application using python
