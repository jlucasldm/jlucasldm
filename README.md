## üëãüèª Hi there!
Hi! I'm Jo√£o Lucas, 24, a Computer Science student at [UFBA](https://ufba.br/), NLP and LLM researcher and Full-stack developer inter at [SERPRO](https://www.serpro.gov.br/) (I also love movies). 

Recently, I finished a scientific project aimed at studying the ethical and sociotechnical aspects of language-based systems and documenting Large Language Models and datasets in Brazilian Portuguese. I documented two datasets (BrWAC and SST2) and three language models (biobertpt-all, bert-portuguese-cased, and sabia-7B). I am very interested in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Large Language Models, and Natural Language Processing, and I have been engaging in training courses and academic studies.

### üíª Some cool projects I made:
- [Ofir, the all-knowing](https://github.com/jlucasldm/langchain_chat): A chatbot developed using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model, refined to interact with the user as an old storyteller from distant lands who knows all about Berserk (up to the Golden Age arc).
- [Neural Language Models Projects](https://github.com/jlucasldm/pln_tomorrow): Projects and materials from the Neural Language Models training course, provided by the Tomorrow project, a partnership between the UFBA Computing Institute and Positivo.
- [Natural Language Processing Projects](https://github.com/jlucasldm/modelos_de_linguagem_neural): Projects and materials from the Natural Language Processing training course, provided by the Tomorrow project, a partnership between the UFBA Computing Institute and Positivo.
- [Thin Ice AI](https://github.com/brunobdcorreia/Thin-Ice-Learning): Two AI agents, using A* and Q-Learning approaches, trained to beat the popular Club Penguin's mini-game, Thin Ice.
- [Classification of Flu Syndrome Notifications](https://github.com/jlucasldm/lab-ia): Final project for the Artificial Intelligence Lab course at the Federal University of Bahia. Two solutions were developed to classify flu syndrome notifications in Bahia in 2024: one using an unsupervised model and the other using a supervised model.
