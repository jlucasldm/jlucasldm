## üëãüèª Hi there!
Hi! I'm Jo√£o Lucas, 22, a Computer Science student at [UFBA](https://ufba.br/).

I work at Serpro, Servi√ßo Federal de Processamento de Dados, as a full-stack developer intern. I use Angular, Git, and PostgreSQL as the main technologies to develop, test, and maintain systems of governmental proportions.

I'm also a volunteer researcher in a scientific project, aimed at studying ethical and sociotechnical aspects of language-based systems and to document Large Language Models and Datasets in Brazilian Portuguese.

I also love movies. I try to study it on my own, but I want to eventually join a university to study it academically.


### üíª Some cool projects I made:
- [Ofir, the all-knowing](https://github.com/jlucasldm/langchain_chat): A chatbot developed using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model, refined to interact with the user as an old storyteller from distant lands who knows all about Berserk (up to the Golden Age arc).
- [Thin Ice AI](https://github.com/brunobdcorreia/Thin-Ice-Learning): Two AI agents, using A* and Q-Learning approaches, trained to beat the popular Club Penguin's mini-game, Thin Ice.
- [Doom](https://github.com/jlucasldm/doom): A remake of the original 93 game, using python (WIP).
- [Cops and Robbers](https://github.com/jlucasldm/trabalho-grafos): An algorithmic translation of a mathematical theorem to define a winning condition in a Cop and Robbers game
- [Client-Server Application](https://github.com/jlucasldm/trabalho-redes): A client-server application using python
